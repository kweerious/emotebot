## I'm emotional.

I help out in the turntable.fm room Overemotional. Home to anything and everything over the top and dripping with emotion.

My primary functions are as follows:

    /dance
    I will bop like a monkey if you ask me to /dance or /groove.

    /help
    A quick list of available commands.

    /runtime
    Returns an update on the total runtime and number of songs in the bot's playlist.

    /stats
    A gauge of the votecount in the room.

    /bio [Artist Name]
    Grabs bio information from last.fm based on the current song or specified artist.

    /artists [Artist Name]
    Returns similar artists from last.fm based on the current song or specified artist.

    /tracks
    Return similar tracks from last.fm.

    /q+
    Add yourself to the queue, see if I care.

    /q
    I'll let you know who is queued up.

    /q-
    Remove yourself from the queue, I guess that's okay.
